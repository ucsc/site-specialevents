## **Raghuram Rajan:** How can India (and developing countries) grow? Navigating an automating and protectionist world


**UC Santa Cruz Chancellor Cynthia Larive and Foundation Board Trustee Anuradha Luther Maitra invite you to the Sidhartha Maitra Memorial Lecture.**

Please join us for the 2025 Sidhartha Maitra Memorial Lecture featuring Raghuram Rajan.

India is at a crossroads today. Its economic growth rate, while respectable relative to other large countries, is too low for the jobs its youth need. The East Asian path of manufacturing-led exports no longer seems feasible—aside from increasing automation in manufacturing, the world isn’t prepared or right for another export-driven economy like China. India broke away from the standard development path—from agriculture to low-skilled manufacturing, then high-skilled manufacturing and, finally, services—a long time back by leapfrogging the intermediate steps.

Instead of now trying to regress to development paths that may no longer be feasible, Dr. Rajan will lay out an alternative path to accelerate economic development and make India a ferment of ideas and creativity. By breaking from the past and looking to the future, India can craft a truly Indian way, a path that could be emulated by other developing countries.
